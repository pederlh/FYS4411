# The restricted Boltzmannn machine applied to the quantum many body problem
## Project 2 - Computational Physics II
### The final report, containing background theory, explanation of the methods and results, can be found [here]().

In this project we apply a Gaussian-Binary RBM to the problem of two interacting bosons confined to a harmonic oscillator trap. We
